# MyApplication
Android application in which audio and image play simultaneously

######Camera.java is a main class here, all other java files are not contributing in this project for now.

##Description:
In this android app I am trying to capture an image and record an audio clip and both have same names but different 
extensions. And map these files paths into a .xml file under a "node"  tag.
So whenever we open an image file using this App the audio file which associated with it start playing.
